## 💡 Quick Start

### Backend (Node.js)

bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start


### Frontend (React)
bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


### PHP/MySQL
1. Place submitReport.php in your web server (e.g., htdocs/phoenixeye/php/).
2. Create a database named phoAdmin and table reports:
   sql
   CREATE TABLE reports (
     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     location VARCHAR(255),
     description TEXT,
     photo VARCHAR(255)
   );
   ```
3. Update DB credentials in submitReport.php if needed.
